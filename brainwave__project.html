                            <b>Investigating Data Protection Mechanisms for EEG Biometric Authentication</b> </br>
                            <i>A Research Study on Privacy-Preserving EEG Biometric Authentication Techniques</i> </br>
                            EEG data is an intriguing new biometric authentication medium. However, users may not be
                            comfortable with the idea of presenting data about their intimate brain state without
                            protections in place. Furthermore, EEG data used for authentication should be considered
                            sensitive, as its leakage could also assist an attacker in exploiting the user in the
                            future. This paper investigates four potential approaches to performing authentication of
                            users with EEG data, without using the raw unprotected EEG signals. The strategies tested
                            were: homomorphic encryption, BioHashing, fuzzy hashing, and Bloom filter templates. These
                            strategies were compared against a baseline model using the standard False Acceptance Rate
                            (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), and Half Total Error Rate (HTER) metrics. HTER was a
                            particular focus, as a representation of a balance between FAR and FRR. Testing found that
                            homomorphic encryption came with significant execution time overhead but performed closest
                            to baseline with an HTER of 0.005. BioHashing exhibited an HTER of 0 or near 0 when the
                            authentication threshold was equally low (e.g., 0.3 or less). Fuzzy hashing consistently
                            reported an HTER between 0.1 and 0.15. Finally, the Bloom filter template approach varied,
                            but hovered close to 0.1 HTER. Fuzzy hashing is designed to accommodate variation in data,
                            which explains its capability when applied to biometric data. Additionally, the combination
                            of normalization with the probabilistic nature of Bloom filter data structures appear to
                            similarly enable their application to this problem. This testing helped to show that
                            authentication with protection mechanisms is possible and could potentially be reliable.
                            Additionally, these tests demonstrated the novel application of fuzzy hashing and Bloom
                            filter templates to EEG-based biometric authentication.

                            <i>A Research Study on EEG-Based Single-Step Authentication as an Alternative to Two-Factor
                                Authentication</i> </br>
                            In the modern digital era, passwords remain a common yet vulnerable means of user
                            authentication, making them susceptible to many attacks. As a result, Two-Factor
                            Authentication (2FA) emerged, offering heightened security. However, its two-step
                            verification process can discourage widespread adoption. This study explores the potential
                            of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals as an innovative alternative to 2FA by combining the
                            authentication and validation processes into a single step. Our research examines different
                            techniques to extract features from raw EEG signals, including band power extraction,
                            statistical features, wavelet features, and Shannon Entropy, to capture these signals’
                            unique and intricate patterns. Additionally, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis
                            of discriminative classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), k-Nearest Neighbors
                            (k-NNs), Multilayer Perceptron’s (MLPs), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to determine
                            the most effective approach for EEG signal-based authentication. We utilize a user-friendly
                            web application that connects with cloud resources to validate our findings and provide a
                            tangible demonstration. This application securely receives and stores EEG signals, allowing
                            them to be evaluated against pre-trained machine-learning models. Our findings highlight the
                            significant potential of EEG signals as a dependable, robust, and secure approach for user
                            authentication, paving the way toward a future where passwords and complex 2FA processes can
                            be substituted with a more convenient and reliable EEG-based authentication system.

                            <b>An Approach to Developing EEG-Based Person Authentication System</b>
                            <i>A Research Study on EEG-Based Authentication Using Neurophysiological Responses to
                                Music</i>
                            The need for a new authentication method such as biometrics becomes apparent as the data
                            breaches on password-based authentication increase. However, current biometric forms of
                            authentication become unusable once compromised. Additional limits are realized when an
                            attacker coerces an authorized user into a forced authentication. To resolve both issues, we
                            propose creating an authentication mechanism that depends on the user's neurophysiological
                            responses to chosen pieces of music (non-lyrical) measured using electroencephalographic
                            (EEG) signals. This research paper provides a guide for creating and presenting a system
                            that incorporates such idea for person classification and authentication. In a group study,
                            the aim is that participant listen to individually selected music and music selected by
                            other participants during an EEG reading. The change in the Alpha and Beta band frequencies
                            across eight electrode EEG sensors serves as the input feature vector for a supervised
                            machine learning algorithm that trains on the user and attacker EEG readings. Ultimately,
                            the goal of the algorithm is to create a user-specific model to uniquely identify the
                            respective user based on the corresponding EEG response to music and grant authentication.
                            Our study lays a solid foundation for creating a promising EEG-based authentication system
                            by solving the drawbacks of current biometric authentication methods.

                            <b>Design and Development of a Mobile EEG Data Analytics Framework</b>
                            <i>A Research Study on EEG Workbench: An Android Framework for EEG Data Analytics and
                                Authentication</i>
                            In this paper, we discuss the design and development of EEG Workbench: a prototyping
                            framework for building electroencephalography (EEG) data analytics framework for the Android
                            platform. EEG data describe the activity of neuron populations in the brain and are acquired
                            via electrodes placed on specific positions in the skull. EEG signals have been shown to be
                            sufficiently different between individuals and therefore suitable for use in the
                            authentication process. The relatively recent introduction of consumer-grade EEG acquisition
                            devices has made the utilization of EEG research more accessible to ubiquitous computing
                            devices such as smartphones; however, the software developed in EEG research lacks specific
                            implementations for Android. EEG Workbench aims to provide developers with a tool to build
                            electroencephalography (EEG) data analytics framework for the Android platform.
